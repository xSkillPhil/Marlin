# MPCNC Version for BTT SKR V1.4 with TMC2209 Steppers, Dual Endstop Version - WIP

This is a fork from [V1Engineering](https://github.com/V1EngineeringInc/Marlin) considering some changes for the use with an SKR V1.4 Board, TMC2209 Steppers with Dual Endstops.

I found some changes needed from [this Repository](https://github.com/spinne-rw/-MPCNC-with-SKR-1.4-Turbo-2209-TMC-Stepper-DualEndstop) that I included into this fork on the latest Version of Marlin provided by V1Engineering.

THIS IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS AND UNTESTED!!
